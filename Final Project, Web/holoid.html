            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Hoshinova Moona</h3>
            <p>Moona is a shy girl, which is the opposite of her image of a flat faced college girl despite the fact she still 
                speaks in an upbeat tone and a rather unique Indonesia accent. Like Tsunomaki Watame, she loves to bob and weave 
                her head and body around. She worked as a fashion model before showing an interest in joining hololive. She loves 
                to shitpost on Twitter while trying to connect with her fans. Moona's last name of "Hoshinova" reflects her overall 
                celestial theme. "Hoshi" (ホシ) is Japanese for "star", while nova, comes from the latin "novus" which means new, 
                nova is also the English word for a star undergoing a massive, transient increase in brightness.
                she is a university student who is also a model and idol. She became a VTuber as she was attracted by the virtual world.
                 She seems to be calm and cool-headed, but scary things are not her cup of tea.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Airani Iofifteen</h3>
            <p>Iofi is a cute, cheerful and open person, but she is prone to panicking when things don't go in her favor or unexpected 
                event happened on her streams. She has exceptional knowledge of Indonesian customs, slang and regional dialects. Her 
                design also speaks for herself as a skilled artist who is currently majoring in VCD. She is a breed of aliens who 
                enjoys drawing. She loves the Earth so much that she successfully entered the school of Virtual Communication 
                and Designs in a university here. She can currently speak 5 languages: Indonesian, English, Japanese and German.
                 She is learning Korean and can speak the language to some degree.[8] She often greets and thanks her viewers in 
                 these languages. One may hear her say "guten tag" (lit. hello) or "고마워" (gomawo, lit. thank you). She self-taught 
                 Japanese and English through Anime, Video Games, and Dramas. Most notably watching Japanese anime with english 
                 subtitles simultaneously. She can write in Hiragana and Katakana and is still learning on reading Kanji</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Ayunda Risu</h3>
            <p>
                Risu has a humorous, high-energy and extremely friendly personality. Risu's interactions with Moona and Iofi, 
                other hololive members and anyone in general, has given her the reputation of being exceedingly sweet, kind and 
                personable. According to herself she can be described as cheerful, clumsy and a crybaby. A squirrel girl who
                 comes from the magicial forest. She once lost her way in the human realm, but was then saved by a kind-hearted 
                 woman with whom she is now living. She treats this woman as her big sis. She debuted as a VTuber just to repay her.
                 Risu has a notably wide vocal-range, even for a singer. At the request of fans she's been able to portray a
                  considerable range of identities through voice affectation, even convincing impersonations of other hololive 
                  members. Risu's fans frequently refer to these identities emulated through voice as "Risu DLC's". Because of her 
                  wide vocal-range, her whistle-like laugh and having said she's a huge fan of Inugami Korone, there is a running 
                  joke that Risu is the child of Korone and Nekomata Okayu. She lives in the same house together with the other 
                  members of hololive Indonesia's 1st Generation, Moona Hoshinova and Airani Iofifteen.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Kureiji Ollie</h3>
            <p>
                Ollie is extraordinarily hyperactive, affecting even her somewhat apprehensive introduction. Having spent a good 
                minute psyching herself up to appear onscreen, when she finally did, she began to loudly wail and panic. Befitting 
                her status as a zombie, Ollie's limbs occasionally detach from her body; her arm fell off at least twice in the first 
                five minutes of her debut. She seems to be very aware of internet and meme culture, as she frequently used internet 
                slang on her debut stream, like "dope", "dank" and "pog", understanding their meaning and usage. She's also a big fan of memes and hopes her 
                 fans make memes out of her. She also tends to randomly flirt with other hololive girls.
                 A zombie high school girl risen from her grave. She headed home, relying on memories retained from when she was still 
                 alive. Upon arriving, she discovered it had turned into a ramen shop! And so, in order to reclaim her house, she 
                 decided to become a VTuber. Ollie is a zombie, but more closely resembles a patchwork golem reminiscent of 
                 Frankenstein's monster. Her skin tone alternates between her (presumably) natural coloration (a light gray) 
                 and the places where replacement flesh was stitched on, which is a darker gray. Ollie's bun-style hair is gray 
                 and red, and her right left eye is red and features a diamond shaped pupil. Her left eye appears to be a yellow 
                 button. Her right ear is pierced with what appears to be a soda can pop-top.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Anya Melfissa</h3>
            <p>
                Anya is a very calm person. She is a bit different from Ollie, she seems to talk a little bit and mumbles more 
                often because she gets nervous during live streams. Rather than her peers like Ollie and Reine, Anya is less 
                sociable with her senpais but has recently started a relationship with one of her senpais, namely Ina.[4] But 
                when provoked or angered, Anya will pull no punches to get her point across, harshly so. Anya is also often 
                categorized as a Yandere girl by some of her fans because of her sadistic comments and thoughts on events in
                 the Mad Father game stream. It was made by her fans that when Anya played horror games, they were not afraid 
                 of ghosts, but afraid of Anya herself. In fact, when playing horror games, Anya typically scoffs off the 
                 scares as if they're sunshine and rainbows. Even so, Anya is also the type of person who is easy to joke around 
                 at certain times. Sometimes, her sense of humor is a bit demeaning to others such as when she called Ollie a 
                 cutting board and made her height a comparison between her senpais as in Gura, Shion, and Rushia. An ancient weapon 
                 known as “Kris”, she was granted human form through a mystical ritual performed by her master. She’s just about
                  always sleeping or playing games. Living mostly alone for so long has made her tend to be apathetic towards things
                   and people she’s uninterested in, but when talking about things she likes, she can be quite childlike and passionate.
