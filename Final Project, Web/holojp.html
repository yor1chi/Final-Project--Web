    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Sakura Miko</h3>
    <p>Miko is a self-proclaimed "elite" gamer who is somewhat
      melodramatic and tends to become emotionally attached to
      NPCs and inanimate objects. Fans tend to use the term "elite"
      ironically to highlight Miko's questionable decision-making skills,
      as well as her tendency to speak garbled nonsense punctuated
      by the occasional F-bomb.Though Miko specializes in role-
      playing games, much of the humor on her channel stems from
      the fact that even while playing graphic and violent games like
      Grand Theft Auto, she rarely takes her role seriously.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Akai Haato</h3>
      Haato appears to be a classic tsundere who teases her fans
      by calling them kimo ota (creepy otaku),among other
      things and sometimes flusters easily. She is mostly calm
      to where others can find relaxation in her streams, with
      Minecraft specifically of note. She has also been referred
      to as seiso (pure) by even the higher ups (managers, ect)
      that they told the other hologirls to use her as the example of purity.
      <br>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Haachama</h3>
      <br>
      Unlike Haato, Haachama can be described as an Eldritch Baby that loves repeating her name.
      With a fondness for Haato's Candy Gothic Lolita outfit, she adopts a very childish personality
      that can sometimes borderline on evil, unsettling or insane despite her cutesy, giggly, playful
      demeanor. Haachama does whatever comes to impulse. She does nothing to discourage creepy behaviors,
      and frequently does weird, creepy things herself such as sniffing her own feet, and decorating her home
      in Animal Crossing: New Horizons with lewd drawings of herself and Tsunomaki Watame and even going so far
      to fondle Haato's breasts whenever she feels discomfort.

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Minato Aqua</h3>
      Aqua is a bumbling airhead who somehow manages to become
      the victim of every joke in which she gets involved. She is also
      childish and prone to throwing tantrums, smashing her
      keyboard, and hyperventilating when things don't go as planned
      (which is most of the time). She enjoys playing pranks and
      causing mischief, but it almost always backfires because of a
      combination of poor planning and bad luck. To make matters
      worse, Aqua makes no attempt to avoid embarrassing situations
      to the point at which many wonder if she might actually be masochistic.

  <div class="block1">
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Pekora Usada</h3>
      <br>
      Pekora hails from the nation of Pekoland, where she claims she
      is a member of royalty. While not much is currently known about Pekoland, it is assumed that its denizens are, like
      Pekora, Animals humans with rabbit-ears and comparatively long lifespans, and that the rabbit-motif
      apparent in Pekora's fashion and accessories is significant to their culture. According to Pekora, "peko"
      is the only word in the Pekolandish language. In-line with her claims of a royal upbringing, Pekora's personality
      can be described as outwardly bratty, haughty, immature and surly, but genuinely playful and friendly.
      But when not on camera she has been noted by other hololive girls as polite and shy, as
      well as one to internalize her pain which ended up prematurely
      ending one of her streams with her in tears.

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Kiryu Coco</h3>
      <br>
      Coco is an outspoken, irreverent individual who often employs crude humor, foul speech
      and swearing, but she isn't as outright lewd as some members like Matsuri in spite of her dominantly
      intense femininity when on stage. She also enjoys teasing other
      members and most segments of her morning news show consists of teasing other hololive
      members over technical difficulties of failings on stream.
      She often pushes the boundaries of what Vtubers can do on YouTube by using thumbnails of her flipping
      the bird or her questionable content. Despite that, Coco is probably one of the biggest hearted members of hololive.
      During a live stream of The Raft with Aqua, Aqua shared her feelings  about how difficult the life of a virtual Idol
      could be and Coco gave some truly kind words of encouragement that nearly brought Aqua to tears.

  <div class="block1">
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Shishiro Botan</h3>
      <br>
      Botan's cool, mature appearance belies a cheerful and easygoing nature.
      She appears as very laid back during streams, even through intense gameplay and abrupt chaos.
      Botan cares deeply for her fellow Generation 5 hololive members, and sometimes acts as a leader
      for the group. She also has a bit of a mischievous streak-examples include dragging her friends
      into playing horror games and attempts to eat Tsunomaki Watame. The mind of a lazy house cat 
      in the body of a fearsome white lion. She’s conscientious and will finish what she has started,
      but good luck getting her to start. Her favorite phrase is, “Go big or go home!”
      She likes building PCs as a hobby and assembled the PC she uses for streams.
      She has some video editing skills, as demonstrated by the introduction in her debut
      stream, which was made by herself. She has a large Russian-speaking fanbase. This is
      possibly due to her outfit's resemblance to an Adidas tracksuit typically worn by gopniks.
