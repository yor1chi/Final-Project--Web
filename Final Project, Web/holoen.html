           <div class="block1">
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Mori Callioppe</h3>
            <p>Calliope is equally excited by both rapping and "reaping". Her favorite
                weapons include her scythe (nicknamed "Ricky") and the flail,
                a medieval weapon made from a spiked metal ball on a chain.
                Although fluent in English, Calliope often fails to understanding
                current modes of speech, such as the use of contractions or
                modern slang. She is easily flustered by romance, leading some to call her the "tsundereaper".
                In addition to English, she can speak Japanese, although she is still learning and actively taking classes.
                She has a habit of randomly making comical gasping noises that sound like "guh", usually after taking a drink.</p>

           <div class="block1">
               <h3 style="text-align: center;">Gawr Gura</h3>
               <p>Gura is friendly and readily likeable, and often amuses her viewers with foolish antics.
                She has no sense of direction, often misspells and mispronounces words, has trouble remembering
                her own age, and consistently fails to solve basic math problems, leading viewers to affectionately
                call her a "dum shark". Memorably, one viewer declared that "Gura has a heart of gold and a head of bone".

                She can also be lazy at times. She often forgets about perishable items until they start to rot, and eats
                baby food "because you don't have to cook it... [or] chew on it".
                However, despite her poor math and spelling skills, Gura is quick-witted, clever, and has vast knowledge of
                Shark Facts. When questioned on why she was not "boing boing", she excused it by claiming that she was
                "hydrodynamic". Her skill with fast-paced rhythm games is exceptional, and she is highly ambitious.
                She also occasionally makes lewd jokes, and is familiar with modern meme culture, which she references often.</p>

        <div class="block1">
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Takanashi Kiara</h3>
            <p>Kiara is enthusiastic and friendly, and is open with her feelings. She cares strongly for her friends
                and family, and misses them a great deal while she is abroad. Although energetic and sometimes chaotic in nature,
                and eager to collab with other members, she is secretly quite shy. She is sometimes bird-brained being forgetful or
                having a short attention span. She prefers video games with fixed goals, such as RPGs, rather than open-world games like Minecraft.

                On a graph ranking members in purity and intelligence, Kiara was rated "bottom left"—maximum lewd and foolish,
                much to her bemusement. However, she often surprises viewers with moments of gentleness, compassion, and insightful wisdom.
                Kiara has a particular fondness for Mori Calliope. Kiara, a phoenix who has been continuously reborn, always meets Calliope each time she dies.
                However, it is not within Calliope's power to keep a phoenix in the Underworld.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Ninomae Ina'nis</h3>
            <p>Despite her otherworldly appearance, Ina is gentle, peaceful and down-to-earth.
                She is considerate and kind; Takanashi Kiara relates that when she is down,
                Ina is always the first to message her. Ina has become widely known for her
                dry delivery of "dad jokes" and octopus-related puns.
                One day, Ina'nis picked up a strange book and then started to gain the power of controlling tentacles.
                To her, tentacles are just a part in her ordinary life; it has never been a big deal for her.
                However, her girly mind does want to get them dressed up and stay pretty.
                She dislikes bugs, being bored, and cucumbers. "I'm not allergic to cucumbers or anything,
                but I just don't like eating them. They smell funny. They smell like cucumbers."
                She is a very talented artist, she drew hololive EN’s members present in their introductory video,
                a few illustrations of herself, the cover of Mori Calliope's Debut EP (DEAD BEATS), and all of
                hololive EN’s first generation member’s mascots.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Amelia Watson</h3>
            <p>Amelia is a rather expressive girl who is often seen mingling or teasing her fellow
                holomyth members (mostly Gura). She is usually kind, supportive, and sweet as shown when
                she often willingly helps the bonehead Gura in Minecraft and is furthermore expressed when
                she frequently watches her fellow members' streams whenever she is available (she even ended
                her own stream just to watch Kiara's stream once).
                Despite her cute angelic appearance and personality, she also harbors another side of
                her personality that is often referred by her fans as "Gremlin Mode", she can be greedy, prideful,
                and unsportsmanlike in competitive online games such as Fall Guys, Apex Legends, and Valorant. Her greed
                is furthermore demonstrated in The Witcher 3 when she is always searching for loot, given the fact that when
                she heard a nearby villager say "loot", she tried to go around and find loot. For these reasons, fans often refer
                to her as a "True Gamer". Despite the circumstances, she tries her best to moderate her gremlin-like behavior.
                Amelia heard strange rumors surrounding Hololive online: talking foxes, magical squirrels, superhuman dogs, and more.
                Soon after beginning her investigation on Hololive, and just out of interest, she decided to become an idol herself!
                She loves to pass her time training her reflexes with FPS games, and challenging herself with puzzle games.
                It's elementary, right?</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Amatsuka Uto</h3>
            Uto is noted for her gentle attitude and cute voice. She tries her best when speaking English. Uto has long, silver-white 
            hair with a halo-shaped ahoge, decorated with silver hair clips and a pair of tiny angel wings. She has bright sky-blue
             eyes. Her clothing is white, with a flowing dress decorated with blue ribbons, and a white ribbon around her neck.
             Uto's illustrator, Nabi, is also the illustrator of hololive EN's Watson Amelia. Uto has described herself as Amelia's 
             sister, as they share the same "mama." However, Uto has a different modeler, Takeshita Fungi, whereas Amelia's "papa"
              is Naname. Fans have drawn art depicting them as siblings. Amelia however does not reciprocate this, considering Uto 
              a cousin at best. She likes to watch hololive. Her favorite hololive members include Usada Pekora, Watson Amelia, Gawr 
              Gura, and Uruha Rushia. After 9 January, Uto ceased streaming for several weeks. On 17 Feburary, she revealed the reason
               as trouble with an agency, including meta-tagging streams with the names of unrelated VTubers and pursuing contracts
                without her consent. Uto announced her intent to return as an independent VTuber. The same day, she uploaded a song 
                cover of KING by Kanaria to YouTube. She returned to streaming on 20 February.
